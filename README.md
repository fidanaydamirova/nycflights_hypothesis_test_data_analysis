# nycflights_hypothesis_test_data_analysis
Used Statistical Hypothesis Testing and Exploratory Data Analysis to find the pattern between departure delay and season/time of a day.
Added for loop to iterate over the all 4 seasons and 4 times of a day, to match each one and perform hypothesis testing on those specific cases.
